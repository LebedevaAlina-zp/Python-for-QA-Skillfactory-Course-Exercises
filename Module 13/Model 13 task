# For an online conference, you need to write a program that calculates the total cost of tickets. The program should work as follows:
# 1. The user is asked for the number of tickets he wants to purchase for the event.
# 2. Next, the age of the visitor is requested for each ticket. According to the age the ticket cost is selected:
#       If the conference visitor is less than 18 years old, then he goes to the conference for free.
#       From 18 to 25 years — 990 r.
#       From 25 years — the full cost of 1390 r.
# 3. As a result of the program, the amount to be paid is displayed. At the same time, if a person registers more than three people for a conference,
# he additionally receives a 10% discount on the full cost of the order.

def tickets_total_cost():
    tickets_num = int(input('How many tickets do you need? '))
    total_cost = 0
    for i in range(1,tickets_num+1):
        age = int(input('Enter the age of person %d: ' % i))
        total_cost += 0 if age < 18 else 990 if 18 <= age < 25 else 1390
        print(total_cost)
    if tickets_num > 3: # We assume here that the customer gets discount no matter the age.
    #if condition total_cost >= 990*3 # In case we have to take into account only adults over 18
        total_cost *= 0.9
    return total_cost

print(tickets_total_cost())
